This repo will provide python examples of Maintaining Modularity

Python version 3.x (interpreter version: 3.7)

Modules ensure that the code is easier to understand, 
and they lower the overwhelming feeling when you delve 
into the code for improvements or feature additions. 
They should encapsulate parts of functionality of a 
system and constrain how these parts interact among each other.
